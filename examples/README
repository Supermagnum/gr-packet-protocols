Example flowgraphs demonstrating the functionality of gr-packet-protocols.

## Available Examples

- **ax25_kiss_example.grc**: Demonstrates AX.25 packet encoding with KISS TNC interface
  - Shows basic packet encoding and transmission
  - Includes PTT control configuration options
  - Configure the KISS TNC block to enable PTT control for hardware transmitters

- **fx25_fec_example.grc**: Demonstrates FX.25 forward error correction encoding

- **il2p_example.grc**: Demonstrates IL2P protocol encoding and decoding

## PTT Control

The `ax25_kiss_example.grc` flowgraph includes PTT (Push To Talk) control functionality
through the KISS TNC block. To use PTT control:

1. Open the flowgraph in GNU Radio Companion
2. Select the KISS TNC block
3. Enable "Enable PTT Control" in the block parameters
4. Select "Use DTR for PTT" if your hardware uses DTR line (default uses RTS)
5. Configure your serial device path (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`)

The KISS TNC block will automatically:
- Key the transmitter (assert DTR/RTS) before sending data
- Apply TX delay timing
- Unkey the transmitter (deassert DTR/RTS) after transmission
- Apply TX tail timing

PTT timing is controlled by the TX delay and TX tail parameters, which can be
set programmatically or via KISS protocol commands.
